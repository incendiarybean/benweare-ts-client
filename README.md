### benweare.co.uk-client

## Description

This repository is the frontend solution for [benweare.co.uk](benweare.co.uk).
It uses the React JS framework to create an easy to build web page.
Please view the [backend](https://github.com/incendiarybean/benweare-ts-server) for the API details.
This site is hosted on Heroku under these applications:

-   [benweare.co.uk](https://benweare.co.uk)
-   [dev.benweare.co.uk](https://dev.benweare.co.uk)

## Usage

This is not intended for usage outside of my personal website, though can be adapted to suit other webscrape/server uses.

This frontend-UI can be installed via NPM: [benweare.co.uk-client]("https://www.npmjs.com/package/benweare.co.uk-client").

In the case that someone else wishes to use this repo, most of the feeds can be adapted by changing the environment variables in the API. The components in this application can be repurposed as they have been built with vague data in mind.
